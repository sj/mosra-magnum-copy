/**
@brief Object shape

@deprecated The @ref Shapes library is a failed design experiment and is
    scheduled for removal in a future release. Related geometry algorithms were
    moved to @ref Math::Distance and @ref Math::Intersection; if you need a
    full-fledged physics library, please have look at [Bullet](https://bulletphysics.org),
    which has Magnum integration in @ref BulletIntegration, or at
    [Box2D](https://box2d.org/), which has a @ref examples-box2d "Magnum example"
    as well.

Adds shape for collision detection to object. Each Shape is part of
some @ref ShapeGroup, which essentially maintains a set of objects which can
collide with each other. See @ref shapes for brief introduction.

The shape contains original shape with relative transformation under
@ref shape() and also caches a shape with absolute transformation under
@ref transformedShape(), which can be used for collision detection. To
conveniently use collision detection among many objects, you need to add the
shape to @ref ShapeGroup, which then provides collision detection for given
group of shapes using either @ref collides(), @ref collision() or
@ref ShapeGroup::firstCollision(). You can also use @ref ShapeGroup::add() and
@ref ShapeGroup::remove() later to manage e.g. collision islands.

auto shape = new Shapes::Shape<Shapes::Sphere3D>(object, {{}, 0.75f}, &shapes);
