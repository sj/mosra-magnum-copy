Contains information about collision between objects A and B, described by
contact position, separation normal and separation distance.

If the collision occured, contact position is on object B surface, separation
normal is *normalized* vector in which direction should object A be moved to
separate the bodies, separation distance is positive and describes minimal
movement of object A in direction of separation normal after which the contact
position will no longer be colliding with object A.

If the collision not occured, contact position and separation normal is
undefined (i.e., *not* normalized) and separation distance is negative or zero.
