# older CMake doesn't support these. No idea how to detect libc++ presence on
# non-Apple platforms (or even version), so I'm giving up there, testing just
# elsewhere.

# Compiler versions where std::optional is supported:
# MSVC 2017 (trust me, I know)

# libc++ 4.0 (see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libc++)
# Apple Clang 9.0 correspons to LLVM 4.0 (see https://gist.github.com/yamaya/2924292#gistcomment-2289472)
